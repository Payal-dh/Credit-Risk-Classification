# Credit-Risk-Classification:
## Evaluating a model based on loan risk. Youâ€™ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Question: 
How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

### Answer: 
The balanced accuracy score of the model, which was 95%, is a result of the data being imbalanced. The number of healthy loans (low-risk) was much higher than the number of non-healthy (high-risk) loans, indicating that the model was better at predicting loan statuses as healthy rather than non-healthy. Based on the imbalanced classification report, the model accurately predicted 85% of healthy loans and 100% of non-healthy loans.

## Question: How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

### Answer: The accuracy score generated by the oversampled model was 99%, which was higher than that of the model fitted with imbalanced data. The oversampled model outperformed the imbalanced model in identifying mistakes such as labeling non-healthy (high-risk) loans as healthy (low-risk). This was evident in the increase of the recall score from 0.91 in the imbalanced model to 0.99 in the oversampled model. A lending company would prefer a model with a higher recall score because misclassifying non-healthy loans as healthy would not be as big of a deal since no funds have been provided to the customer. However, misclassifying healthy loans as non-healthy would result in a loss of customers, whereas misclassifying non-healthy loans as healthy would result in a loss of funds for the lending company.
